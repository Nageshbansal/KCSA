# KCSA Preparation

A repository containing the resources and notes to prepare for KCSA certification

While i was preparing for the certification I found that there were not so many resources other than Kubernetes Docs and github wikis put together by some great folks (I've mentioned all of them in Resources section)

The repostitory is still under progress, trying to put all the notes in a better manner.
